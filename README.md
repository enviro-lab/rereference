# rereference
A tool for repositioning reads in a bam file relative to a different reference sequence. This is great if you want to align a SARS-CoV-2 sample to one of the more recent lineages and then reposition the coordinated to match the positions where the reads would map to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence.
